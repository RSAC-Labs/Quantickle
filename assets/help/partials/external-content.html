    <h4>What counts as external</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Node <strong>icon</strong> or <strong>backgroundImage</strong> fields that start with <code>http(s)://</code> or <code>file:</code>.</li>
        <li>Graph background images that point to remote URLs.</li>
    </ul>

<div class="help-section">
    <h4>When a prompt appears</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Choose <strong>Allow</strong> to keep the images and continue loading.</li>
        <li>Choose <strong>Block</strong> to strip the URLs; the graph still loads, just without external pictures.</li>
        <li>The same choice is offered next time you open the file, so you can change your mind later.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Keep things smooth</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Prefer workspace-relative image paths or built-in icons to avoid prompts.</li>
        <li>If an image fails to load, try opening the URL in a browser tab to confirm it is reachable.</li>
    </ul>
